Escaping the Maze
In Reeborg's simulation of a maze, we have to write a program such that the robot successfully comes out of the maze

In this section, we have covered functions, while loop and Indentation. 

We are working in a interactive website thats called Reeborg's World.

Functions - Blocks of code that runs when we call it.
SYNTAX -> def fun_name():   # blocks of code below
              [BODY]
Function call -> fun_name()


While loop runs continuously until the condition is false
SYNTAX -> while condition:
              [BODY]
