There are many modules that comes with Python standard library, i.e it comes with the python language application. It has some basic packages. Those packages we can directly import and use it. 
But other packages, we have to install and use it. We have to use the **pip install package_name** to install, and then import it in our program. 


### Tuple
Data Structure is very similar to a list, but only difference is it cannot be modified. Used when we don’t want any accidental changes. 

**Declaration** → my_tuple = (1,2,3,4,5)
**Accessing the index** → my_tuple[2]
**To change tuple to list** → list(my_tuple)
